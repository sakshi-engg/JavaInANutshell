Generics In Java

The Java Generics programming is introduced in J2SE 5 to deal with type-safe objects. 
It makes the code stable by detecting the bugs at compile time.

Before generics, we can store any type of objects in the collection, i.e., non-generic. 

****Now generics force the java programmer to store a specific type of objects.*****

Advantage of Java Generics

1) Type-safety: We can hold only a single type of objects in generics. It doesn't allow to store other objects.


2) Type casting is not required: There is no need to typecast the object.

Before Generics, we need to type cast.


3) Compile-Time Checking: It is checked at compile time so problem will not occur at runtime. 
The good programming strategy says it is far better to handle the problem at compile time than runtime.

Syntax to use generic collection

-> ClassOrInterface<Type>   

Example to use Generics in java

-> ArrayList<String>
